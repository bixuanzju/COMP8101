\section{Introduction}


A transaction can be regarded as a transformation from one state to another. In the context of database, a transaction is a collection of operations executed in certain order to perform some specific functions by accessing and/or updating the data. It is a reliable and coherent process unit performed on a database system and plays a central role. There is no real information system can work without a proper transaction management component that prevents it from entering unexpected states during execution. In the domain of computer science, its original definition as a database transaction was extended and generalized by using complex structures to support a wide range of applications.

This review is structured as follows. First we introduce the background concept and develop history of transaction, including the classical model and more advanced models. Then the key concepts and techniques in modern time transaction processing models are discussed. The paper ends with conclusions and a brief description of the potential research problem we proposed.


\section{History of transaction}

\subsection{Classical model}

The most fundamental properties of transaction are the ACID properties which are identified during 1980s \cite{gray1981transaction, haerder1983principles}. They guarantee all the transactions are processed reliably, failure atomic and serializable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Atomicity: A transaction either runs completely or has no effect at all. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.
    \item Consistency: A transaction is a correct program which will bring the database from one valid state to another. After the execution, the new state of the database must comply with all the consistency constraints.
    \item Isolation: A transaction is executed as if there are no other concurrent transactions. The effect of the concurrent transactions is the same as the effect when the transactions are executed one after the other.
    \item Durability: Once a transaction has been committed, it makes a permanent change to the state of the database. The results must be able to be reestablished after any possible failures.
\end{itemize}

Traditional transactions with ACID properties, which are also known as flat transactions as they have no internal structures are executed by the transaction processing systems. A transaction processing system usually contains a monitor, one or more DBMS and application programs \cite{lewis2002databases}.

Atomicity and durability are guaranteed by the mechanism of recovery that is usually implemented by maintaining a log of update operations so that 'redo' and 'undo' actions can be performed when required. Isolation is guaranteed by the mechanism of concurrency control, which is implemented by using locks during the transaction process \cite{chrysanthis1996advances}. Consistency is guaranteed by the integrity control mechanism usually provided by the transaction processing system, though not complete in a strict sense.

Because of its simplicity, flat transactions model is very useful in traditional database systems where the execution time is relatively short, the number of concurrent transactions is relatively small and transactions execute on only one database. However, the model lacks flexibility and is not suitable for some complex applications such as multi-database operations and workflow systems.

\subsection{Advanced model}

Advanced transaction models were proposed to enhance the ability to support applications requiring long-living and/or complex transactions. Its fundamental idea is to divide a transaction into sub-transactions according to the semantics of the applications. These sub-transactions (also called component transactions) can again be divided if necessary. The advanced transactions can perform more complex and longer-lasting tasks. For example, when a failure occurs during the execution of a long-living transactional process, the system is able to restart from the middle of the transaction instead of the very beginning.

Failure recovery is a very important topic for transaction processing. To minimize the lost of data, the concept of checkpoints was introduced into transaction. A checkpoint is a persistent copy of the state of database. In case an error occurs, the state of database can be restored by loading one checkpoint copy, and unfinished operations can be continually executed based on the new copy of database. This technique is widely used among current database systems. Based on checkpoint mechanism, distributed transactions, nested transactions, chained transactions are developed during the 1980s. A chained transaction is a variation of checkpoints, while the nested transaction is a generalization of save points \cite{gray1992transaction}. These models are mostly designed for certain situations.


Distributed transactions consist of sub-transactions that may access multiple local database systems. Multi-database systems impose global integrity constraints on a transaction as well as global atomicity and isolation. For example, the whole transaction is aborted if any sub-transaction fails. Nested transactions adopt a top-down method to decompose a complex transaction into sub-transactions according to their functionalities \cite{moss1981nested}. It overcomes the shortcomings of single-level transactions by permitting parts to fail without necessarily aborting the entire transaction. The mechanism of the model is very powerful and has a strong relationship with the concept of modularization in software engineering \cite{gray1992transaction}. This paper \cite{weikum1992concepts} proposes multilevel transactions (also called layered transactions) and their generalization, open nested transactions, based on the idea of nested transactions. A multilevel transaction is a variation of a nested transaction where a transaction tree has its levels corresponding to the layers of the underlying system architecture.

Although the nested transaction and its extensions are more powerful than the classical flat transaction, they are only applicable in specific environments but are not suitable for environments requiring long-lived transactions. The idea of chained transactions by decomposing a long running transaction into small, sequentially-executing sub-transactions was proposed. In the chain, a sub-transaction triggers the next upon commit, one by one, until the whole chained transaction commit. The saga model \cite{garcia1987sagas} based on the idea of chained transactions is a classic transaction model used as a foundation of many later transaction models. Sagas divide a long lasting transaction into sequentially executed sub-transactions and each sub-transaction, except the last one, has a corresponding compensating sub-transaction. All these sub-transactions are atomic with ACID properties.


\section{Transaction Processing in Modern Times}
\label{sec:modern}

Many transaction processing models mentioned in the previous sections
were invented before the ``Internet age''. With the advent of
Internet, many new challenges, both theoretical and technical, have
arisen. In this section, we place our focus on the transaction
processing models in modern times. Specifically, we cover web service
transactions in Section~\ref{sec:web}, grid transitions in
Section~\ref{sec:grid} and mobile transaction models in
Section~\ref{sec:mobile}.

\subsection{Web service transactions}
\label{sec:web}

Over the period of late 1990s until now, more and more research
efforts have been put to the area of transactions in the Web services
(WS) world. Besides numerous standards such as SOAP~\cite{soap},
WSDL~\cite{wsdl}, UDDI~\cite{uddi}, etc., a new standard is called for
to ensure the consistency and reliability of WS
applications. Currently there are three competing standardization
efforts. For the space reason, we focus on one candidate, i.e., the
combined Web Service Transaction specifications, also known as WS-Tx,
consisting of WS-Coordination (WS-C), WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT),
and WS-BusinessActivity (WS-BA)~\cite{wsc, wsat, wsba}. We briefly
mention the other two, i.e., the Business Transaction Protocol
(BTP)~\cite{btp} and Web Services Composite Application Framework
(WS-CAF)~\cite{wscaf}.

The WS-Tx specifications define mechanisms for transactional
interoperability between Web services domains. The specifications are
aimed at the reliable and consistent execution of web based business
transactions using different interconnected Web services.

\subsubsection{WS-Coordination}
\label{sec:wsc}

Web services involve many participants, thus a lot of issues related
to Web services require coordination. WS-Coordination provides a
generic coordination infrastructure for Web services, making it
convenient to plug in specific coordination
protocols~\cite{little2003introducing}.

Three services necessary to support coordination protocols are
specified in the framework:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Activation Service, which creates a new activity coordinator
  that uses a specific coordination protocol.
\item The Registration Service, which is responsible for the
  registration of a new participant and selection of the coordination
  protocol.
\item The Coordination Service makes sure that all registered Web
  services are brought to completion by the selected protocol. The
  protocol defines the behavior and operations that are required for
  the completion of an activity.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{WS-AtomicTransaction}
\label{sec:wsat}

The WS-AtomicTransaction specification focuses on existing transaction
systems and protocols with strict ACID requirements. Traditionally,
these systems are heterogeneous, so the first step towards
interoperability is to couple them with one organization.

However, just coupling systems doesn't give you interoperability
between systems of different organizations for free. Many issues arise
because of the well-known interoperability problems related to
semantic differences, autonomy, non-disclosure, etc. A simple yet
valid solution is to wrap the backend systems/application as a Web
Services.

With WS-AT specification, one is able to offer an application as a Web
Service, and also specify its transactional behavior (ACID for
example) in case the service in question is involved in an
intra-organizational process.

Participants in an WS-AT should support the following requirements
that assumed by the protocol~\cite{wsat}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Updates are isolated until they are committed.
\item There is a single all or nothing decision for all participants.
\item Any participating systems in the transaction can abort the
  entire transaction.
\end{itemize}

As can be seen, this requires a high mutual trust between the
participants in such a transaction, thus making it hard to be adopted
for inter-business transactions.


\subsubsection{WS-BusinessActivity}
\label{sec:wsba}

Since the WS-AT specification resembles traditional 2PC ACID
transactions, it suffers the same problem. To avoid such problems and
to support long-running business transactions, the business activity
coordination type has been introduced.

As we know, atomic transactions handle system generated exceptions
transparently from the application that drives the
transaction. However the application does not need to care about the
system generated exception. Instead, it can focus on the handling of
application generated exceptions. To ensure this, WS-BA uses atomic
transitions to preserve the autonomy of participating organizations.

Some characteristics of business activities in WS-BA include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Participants are autonomous and can exit activities at will.
\item The state of the business activity is made persistent between
  steps in order to reach a desired goal, even if exceptions occur.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Grid transactions}
\label{sec:grid}

\subsection{Mobile transaction models}
\label{sec:mobile}



\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:modern}

In the classical model of database transactions, transactions are modelled as atomic and isolated units of work. This model has been widely successful in traditional database applications. However, sometimes transactions must be combined and coordinated with other code or programs to achieve a larger goal. We propose to investigate programming language features for specifying non-classical transactions, which can easily combine transactions with other codes into complex processes. This built-in feature may improve the readability, scalability and performance of transition related programs.


% \section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
% Typically, the body of a paper is organized
% into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
% headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
% smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
% precedes this paragraph is part of such a
% hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
% starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
% informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
% and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
% how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
% and placement of these headings for you, when you use
% the appropriate heading commands around the titles
% of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
% smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
% asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
% numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
% balance of this sample document.

% Because the entire article is contained in
% the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
% start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
% input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

% \subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
% We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
% can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
% the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
% command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
% and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
% \texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
% have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
% part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
% article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
% be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
% Let's make this a rather short one to
% see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
% document class file. Take care with the use
% of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
% the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
% the beginning and end of
% the text that is to be in the different typeface.

% You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
% non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
% you can find a complete list of what is
% available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
% User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

% \subsection{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
% the three are discussed in the next sections.

% \subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an
% inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
% \textbf{math} environment, which can be
% invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
% construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
% can use any of the symbols and structures,
% from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
% few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
% this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% \subsubsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
% from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
% by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
% equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
% and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
% give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
% First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

% \subsection{Citations}
% Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
% clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
% conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
% books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
% in the Bibliography section of your
% article will occur throughout the text of your article.
% You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
% you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
% a key of the item cited in the proper location in
% the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
% The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
% identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
% the first author's surname and a
% word from the title.  This identifying key is included
% with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

% The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
% are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
% information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
% and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
% Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

% This article shows only the plainest form
% of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
% This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
% No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

% \subsection{Tables}
% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
% placement for them is typically the top of the page
% nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
% the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
% in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
% be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
% horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
% on \textbf{tabular} material
% is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed
% dvi output of this document.

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
% Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
% \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
% $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
% \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
% $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
% \hline\end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
% the page's live area, use the environment
% \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
% the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
% table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the
% table here with the table in the printed dvi
% output of this document.


% \begin{table*}
% \centering
% \caption{Some Typical Commands}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
% Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
% \end{table*}
% % end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

% \subsection{Figures}
% Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
% best placement for them
% is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
% their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
% of figures, use the environment
% \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

% This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps} files to be
% displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
% \textbf{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ system will convert
% \textbf{.eps} to \textbf{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
% each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

% As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
% that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
% ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
% \textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
% and don't forget to end the environment with
% {figure*}, not {figure}!

% \subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
% Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
% the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
% corollaries and proofs.  There are
% two forms, one produced by the
% command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
% other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
% the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
% to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

% This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
% the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
% \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
% \begin{theorem}
% Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
% an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
% \begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
% \end{theorem}

% The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
% by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
% \newdef{definition}{Definition}
% \begin{definition}
% If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
% unique number which has
% logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
% \end{definition}

% Two lists of constructs that use one of these
% forms is given in the
% \textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

% There is one other similar construct environment, which is
% already set up
% for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
% a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
% create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
% is a example of its use:
% \begin{proof}
% Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
% \begin{displaymath}
% \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
% \end{displaymath}
% Then
% \begin{displaymath}
% l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
% \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
% \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
% \end{displaymath}
% which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
% \end{proof}

% Complete rules about using these environments and using the
% two different creation commands are in the
% \textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
% detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
% not listed therein, which you want to have the same
% formatting as the Theorem
% or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
% \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
% respectively, to create it.

% \subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
% Because you have just been given permission to
% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
% new form, you might think you can
% use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
% new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
% Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
% to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
% to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
% some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
% be, to say the least, problematic.

% \section{Conclusions}
% This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
% Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
% Appendices; brief samples of these
% follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
% we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
% of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
% this paper are to articles which have nothing to
% do with the present subject and are used as
% examples only.

% %ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
% \section{Acknowledgments}
% This section is optional; it is a location for you
% to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
% what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
% authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
% his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
% and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{report}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional

% %Appendix A
% \section{Headings in Appendices}
% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
% the body of the article are different in the appendices.
% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
% \textbf{section} is used to
% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
% hierarchical structure
% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
% document in Appendix-appropriate form:
% \subsection{Introduction}
% \subsection{The Body of the Paper}
% \subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
% \subsubsection{Math Equations}
% \paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% \paragraph{Display Equations}
% \subsubsection{Citations}
% \subsubsection{Tables}
% \subsubsection{Figures}
% \subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
% \subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
% \subsection{Conclusions}
% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
% \subsection{Additional Authors}
% This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
% You just add the names and information in the
% \texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
% of the document.
% \subsection{References}
% Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
% then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
% the .tex source file and comment out
% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% % This next section command marks the start of
% % Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
% \section{More Help for the Hardy}
% The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
% and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
% experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
% it useful but please remember not to change it.
